# Hover.com Automated DNS Update Script

This script automates the process of logging into Hover.com and updating the DNS records of specified domains with a new public IP. It uses Selenium for web automation, `requests` for fetching the public IP, Twilio to send notifications when a CAPTCHA is detected, and `twocaptcha` to help solve the CAPTCHA.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- ChromeDriver

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory where you've cloned the repository.

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium twilio twocaptcha python-dotenv requests
```

4. Download the appropriate version of [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) for your system and place it in the script directory or ensure it's in your system's `PATH`.

5. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your script. Add your Hover.com login credentials, Twilio credentials, TwoCaptcha API key, Twilio phone number, your phone number, and the list of domains to be updated. Here's a sample format:

```plaintext
HOVER_USERNAME=your_hover_username
HOVER_PASSWORD=your_hover_password
TWO_CAPTCHA_API_KEY=your_twocaptcha_api_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE=your_twilio_phone_number
USER_PHONE=your_phone_number
DOMAINS=domain1_url,domain2_url,domain3_url,...
```

Replace the placeholders (`your_hover_username`, `your_hover_password`, etc.) with your actual credentials.

6. Run the script using:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script.

## Important Notes

- Always be careful when handling sensitive information, such as login credentials and API tokens. Using environment variables is a good way to keep them out of your scripts, but you should also ensure you're using secure methods to protect and access them.
- Ensure your `.env` file is secure and do not push it to public repositories.
- The script uses XPaths to interact with the website. If Hover.com changes its website structure, these XPaths may become outdated and the script may not function as expected. Always test the script in a safe environment before using it in production.
